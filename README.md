# Hotel Booking Demand and Cancellation Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking demand and cancellations using a comprehensive dataset containing booking details for both City and Resort Hotels. The analysis explores key trends in customer behavior, booking patterns, and factors contributing to cancellations. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, the project aims to uncover actionable insights that can assist hotels in optimizing their booking systems, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing cancellations.
## What I did in this Project:

### **Data Preparation**
- Loaded a dataset containing over **119390 hotel booking records**.
- Handled missing values:
  - Dropped columns with excessive missing data (`company`).
  - Filled gaps in `children`, `agent`, and `country` columns.
- Optimized memory usage by converting categorical data types.
---
### **Data Preprocessing**
- Removed outliers:
  - Unrealistic lead times above the 99th percentile.
  - Bookings with zero guests or invalid revenue values.

### **Feature Engineering**
- **Total Staying Nights**: Combined weekday and weekend stays.
- **Total Guests**: Calculated the sum of adults, children, and babies for each booking.
- **Revenue Indicator**: Added a flag for bookings that generated revenue.
- **Total Revenue**: Calculated revenue as `ADR (Average Daily Rate) Ã— Total Staying Nights`.

## Visualizations
- **Booking Trends**: Seasonal demand visualized using bar charts.
- **Lead Time Analysis**: Histograms and violin plots to analyze lead time distributions.
- **Cancellation Analysis**:
  - Heatmaps showing cancellation rates by deposit type and lead time.
  - Bar charts displaying cancellation rates by hotel type and market segment.
- **Revenue Analysis**:
  - Bar charts showing revenue by hotel type and market segment.
  - Monthly trends in **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**.
- **Customer Segmentation**:
  - Market segment and country-wise booking distribution.
  - Analysis of first-time vs. repeated guests.

## Insights and Outcomes

### **Cancellations**
- Higher lead times correlate with increased cancellations.
- Non-refundable deposits significantly reduce cancellation rates.

### **Demand Patterns**
- Peak booking demand occurs in **July and August**.
- City Hotels see more bookings but higher cancellations compared to Resort Hotels.

### **Revenue Trends**
- Resort Hotels generate significant revenue despite fewer bookings.
- **Online Travel Agents** dominate revenue sources.

### **Customer Segmentation**
- Most bookings come from a few countries, emphasizing the importance of targeted marketing strategies.
- Repeat guests, though fewer, are valuable for long-term growth.
