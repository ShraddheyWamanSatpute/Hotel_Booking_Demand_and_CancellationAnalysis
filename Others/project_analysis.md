# Hotel Booking Demand and Cancellation Analysis - Detailed Notes

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to uncover patterns, trends, and factors influencing cancellations. Using a dataset containing over 119,390 bookings from City and Resort Hotels, the project explores:
- Seasonal demand trends
- Customer behavior and demographics
- Revenue patterns
- Key factors affecting cancellations

The goal is to derive actionable insights to help hotels optimize their booking systems, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce cancellations.

## Data Overview
The dataset contains the following key information:
- **Hotel Types**: City Hotel and Resort Hotel.
- **Customer Information**: Demographics, special requests, and booking details.
- **Booking Details**: Arrival dates, lead times, and length of stay.
- **Revenue Information**: Average daily rate (ADR) and total revenue generated.
- **Cancellations**: Records of bookings canceled by customers.

### Key Challenges:
1. **Missing Values**: Columns such as `country`,`agent`, `company`, and `children` had missing values that needed to be addressed.
2. **Outliers**: Unusually high lead times and negative ADR values required handling.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Removal of invalid data entries (e.g., zero guests in a booking).

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The analysis explored several trends and behaviors:
- **Booking Trends**:
  - City Hotels receive more bookings than Resort Hotels.
  - Demand peaks during the summer months (July and August).
  - Bookings from online travel agents dominate other market segments.

- **Cancellations**:
  - Approximately 37% of all bookings are canceled.
  - City Hotels have a higher cancellation rate (41%) compared to Resort Hotels (27%).
  - Longer lead times and refundable deposits correlate with higher cancellation rates.

- **Revenue Patterns**:
  - Resort Hotels generate higher average revenue per booking than City Hotels.
  - Non-refundable deposits are associated with reduced cancellations and stable revenue generation.

- **Customer Segmentation**:
  - Most bookings originate from a few countries, emphasizing the importance of localized marketing strategies.
  - First-time guests form the majority of customers, while repeat guests are more loyal and generate consistent revenue.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
To enhance the dataset and enable deeper analysis, several new features were created:
- **Total Staying Nights**: Combined weekday and weekend stays into one metric.
- **Total Guests**: Summed up adults, children, and babies in each booking.
- **Revenue Indicator**: A flag indicating whether a booking generated revenue based on its status.
- **Total Revenue**: Calculated as ADR Ã— Total Staying Nights for revenue-generating bookings.

### 3. **Visualizations**
The following visualizations provided key insights:
- **Booking Trends**:
  - Bar charts showing monthly booking patterns.
  - Comparisons of demand between City and Resort Hotels.

- **Lead Time Analysis**:
  - Histograms displaying the distribution of lead times.
  - Violin plots illustrating the relationship between lead time and ADR.

- **Cancellation Analysis**:
  - Heatmaps visualizing cancellation rates by deposit type and market segment.
  - Bar charts comparing cancellation rates by hotel type.

- **Revenue Insights**:
  - Bar charts showing total revenue by hotel type and market segment.
  - Line plots of monthly ADR trends.

- **Customer Behavior**:
  - Bar charts of booking counts by market segment and customer origin.
  - Pie charts depicting the proportion of repeated vs. first-time guests.

## Key Findings
1. **Cancellations**:
   - Longer lead times increase the likelihood of cancellations.
   - Non-refundable deposits significantly reduce cancellation rates.
2. **Demand Patterns**:
   - City Hotels experience higher demand but also higher cancellations.
   - Peak demand occurs during summer, especially for Resort Hotels.
3. **Revenue Insights**:
   - Resort Hotels contribute a higher average revenue per booking.
   - Online travel agencies dominate revenue generation.
4. **Customer Insights**:
   - Repeat guests form a small but valuable customer segment.
   - Most bookings originate from a few top countries.

## Challenges and Limitations
   
1. **External Factors**:
   - The analysis does not account for external influences such as weather conditions, economic events, or global phenomena (e.g., pandemics), which could significantly impact booking behavior.

2. **Dataset Scope**:
   - The dataset only captures historical bookings without real-time or forward-looking indicators, limiting its applicability for dynamic pricing or real-time decision-making.

3. **Limited Revenue Insights**:
   - Revenue calculations are based solely on the `adr` metric without considering additional costs or discounts, potentially oversimplifying revenue insights.

## Future Work

1. **Advanced Predictive Modeling**:
   - Implement machine learning models to predict booking cancellations and revenue, providing actionable insights for hotel management.

2. **Integration of Additional Data**:
   - Include external datasets such as customer reviews, weather conditions, or regional events to enrich the analysis and improve predictions.

3. **Dynamic Visualizations**:
   - Will try to develop interactive dashboards using **Streamlit** to visualize insights and outputs, making the project accessible to stakeholders in real time.

4. **Seasonality Analysis**:
   - Will Include advanced seasonality trends and their impact on booking behaviors using time-series models.

5. **Real-Time Analysis**:
   - Will Extend the project to include live booking data for real-time analysis and decision-making.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry. The analysis provides actionable insights to:
- Reduce cancellations through strategic deposit policies.
- Optimize marketing efforts for high-demand periods and key customer segments.
- Improve revenue generation through targeted pricing and promotions.

By addressing customer behavior and market trends, hotels can enhance their operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
